    <h1> Hi! Here's my day 1 homework. </h1> 
    <h4> In this game, the user is prompted how many questions he or she wants to answer.  The game then generates an array of randomized numbers equal to the number of questions the user selected (avoiding duplicates).  The numbers in the array are associated with functions, which are then called.  The questions are printed to the dom (added as list elements), as are the user's responses.  A right or wrong display is also written to the page, and rewritten each time the user answers a new question. Finally, a summary is displayed as an alert when the user finishes the game.
