	<h1>About Patrick Trompeter</h1>
	<p><strong>Summary:</strong> I am a software developer based in Seattle, WA. I am a logic junkie who thrives on writing clean, fast code for web-based applications. As a recovering lawyer, I bring strong research, reasoning, and small group management skills to my team.  I also excel at long range planning and strategic thinking. </p>

	<p><strong>Biography:</strong>I was born and raised in Seattle.  I attended college at the University of Chicago, from which I received a degree in economics.  I returned to Seattle to attend law school at the University of Washington.  I took the bar in Washington and practiced law for a decade until I became tired of bickering for a living and decided to do something more productive.  I now put my reasoning and communications skills building applications to make people daily interactions more fun and convenient.  I currently live in Ballard with my wife, Merit.
